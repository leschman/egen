# EGEN 310 Salinity Sensor Code
There are two main aspects of the code: 
* Code for the Arduino, 
* Code for the Application (runs on computer, Ras Pi for us)

The requirements for these aspects (as I see them) have been documented [here](https://github.com/leschman/egen/issues). They have been grouped into milestones under their respective aresas.
